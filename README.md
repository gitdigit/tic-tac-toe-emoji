## üòõ Tic Tac Toe Emoji 

A tic-tac-toe game based on emojis that offers both multiplayer and single-player modes. Every time a user plays in single or multiplayer mode, there are always new emojis.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single Player 

In this mode, you will play against a computer bot. 

- Click on the 'Single Player' button to play.
- The player who gets 3 in a row first wins.
- Whether it's a win, loss, or a draw, a modal displaying the result appears once the game is over. You'll then see two buttons:
  - **Replay'** button to play again.
  - **Home** button to return to the main menu.
- If you leave the page and come back, you'll resume the game from where you left off.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multiplayer 

In this mode, you can play with another person sitting next to you.

- The first player is automatically selected, and the second player automatically gets their own emoji (random for every game round).
- The player who gets 3 in a row first wins.
- Whether it's a win, loss, or a draw, a modal displaying the result appears once the game is over. You'll then see two buttons:
  - 'Replay' button to play again.
  - 'Home' button to return to the main menu.
- If you leave the page and come back, you'll resume the game from where you left off.

## ü§î How Can It Be Improved?

The project could be improved by adding sound effects and background music. I think it would also be cool to highlight the three rows that the user got to win, to show at the end who won. I also want people to run the project in their local machine with vitest.
